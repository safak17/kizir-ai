    "Course Content": "The course introduces the fundamentals of object-oriented information system development with a focus on analysis and design phases. Data modeling and design principles such as data abstraction, information hiding, modularity, and coupling are viewed in the context of object-oriented paradigm. For object-oriented modeling Unified Modeling Language (UML) is introduced and used extensively throughout the course. Unified process is taken as the basis for development efforts. Issues relating to making the transition from other software development methodologies are examined and risks involved in object-oriented process are discussed."
