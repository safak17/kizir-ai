    "Course Content": "This course serves as a deficiency course for non-statisticians who are studying informatics at graduate level. Fundamentals of statistical methods and probability theory will be covered with specific examples and applications from cases in informatics and bioinformatics research. The topics offered in this course are; Counting, permutations and combinations, axioms of probability, conditional probability and independence, random variables, basic distributions of discrete and continuous random variables, functions of random variables, expectation, variance, covariance and correlation, sampling distributions, the central limit theorem, estimation and confidence intervals, bias, sufficiency, efficiency and consistency of estimators, hypothesis testing, common tests, error types. Non-parametric tests. Linear regression and ANOVA."
