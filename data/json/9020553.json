    "Course Objectives": "<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0; URL=noscript.html\">METU | Course SyllabusCourse ObjectivesThe course will review research on physicological and computational oculomotor processes related to reading starting from perceptually oriented processes, such as orthography and proceeding towards conceptual, cognitive processes, as well as sociocultural aspects in how humans have been reading and writing throughout the history. Accordingly, the early part of the course will deal with orthography, phonology and word identification processes at sub-word level and word-level. Then the investigation of eye movements will be introduced as a core methodology for studying oculomotor control in reading. The lectures will proceed with the investigation of several models of eye movement control in reading. Finally, comprehension at sentential and discourse level will be introduced by providing theoretical frameworks briefly and example studies to improve experimental skills of course students.",
    "Course Learning Outcomes": "<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0; URL=noscript.html\">METU | Course SyllabusCourse Learning OutcomesAt the end of this course, the students will be able to develop graduate-level research proposals on reading and language comprehension, they will have learned the basics of eye movement control in reading, as well as the basics of experimental design in reading research.",
    "Course Content": "The course will review research on psychological processes related to reading starting from the more perceptual and proceeding towards conceptual and global issues. The early part of the course will deal with the control of eye movements and registration of visual information during reading. Then issues related to word identification such as alternative models of visual word recognition and possible role of phonological coding in visual word identification will be discussed. Other topics will include constructing mental representations from text, learning, reading, developmental and acquired reading disabilities."
