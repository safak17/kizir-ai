In the first part, an introduction to object oriented programming is given. Students will learn Python programming language and will be able to write code to solve basic programming problems. An introduction to asymptotic algorithm analysis will be presented.Second part is about algorithms and data structures. Students will learn the commonly used data structures to represent data such as arrays, trees, linked-lists, hash tables, stacks and queues. Students will learn basic sorting algorithms and be able to analyze space and time complexity of those algorithms.",
