    "Course Learning Outcomes": "<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0; URL=noscript.html\">METU | Course SyllabusCourse Learning OutcomesUpon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:Cite at least 8 pieces work that were influential in the development of cognitive science and summarize their contributions to the field.Explain functionalism, which is the main philosophical idea behind cognitive science.Describe what the symbol-manipulation paradigm is.Formulate arguments and write position papers on disputable topics in cognitive science.Summarize main theories and arguments which have challenged classical symbolic computation view in cognitive science.Describe the main architectural properties of at least two computational models of cognition.",
    "Course Content": "The course provides an introduction to cognitive science from the perspective of natural and artificial cognitive systems. It is specifically designed to address graduate and eligible undergraduate students who want to learn about the body of knowledge in cognitive science in relation to their own field of study. It provides a historical overview of cognitive science, describes its philosophical foundations, introduces classical pieces of work that have shaped the studies, and discusses cognitive models which are based on empirical studies of natural and artificial minds and intelligence."
