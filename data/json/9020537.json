    "Course Objectives": "<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0; URL=noscript.html\">METU | Course SyllabusCourse ObjectivesFirst, in terms of theoretical knowledge, a novel approach to cognition - dynamic systems - will be introduced to students and compared with the two classical approaches: computational theory of mind and connectionism. The novelty of the dynamic paradigm in terms of various dichotomies, e.g., change/process > state, timing > order, parallel > serial, will be pointed out to the students. Basic notions such as what complex non-linear dynamic systems (NDS) are and what properties they have (attractors, chaos, self-organization, etc.) will be explained.Second, this novel paradigm will be explored in various domains of cognition - visual perception, coordinated action, learning & memory, time, cognitive and language development, communication - in terms of behavioral and brain processes. The concept of \"emergence\" - whether and how novelty can arise in a dynamic system - will be discussed in philosophical terms.Third, the fundamental property of objects in the real world as well as (cognitive) processes of being \"fractal\" (spatially as well as temporally) will be brought to the attention to students.",
    "Course Learning Outcomes": "<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0; URL=noscript.html\">METU | Course SyllabusCourse Learning OutcomesFirst, students will be able to critically evaluate and compare the three main approaches to Cognition – computational theory of mind, connectionism, dynamic systems – with each other. They will be knowledgeable about the distinctive properties and features of non-linear dynamic systems, most prominently attractors, chaos, and self-organization.Second, students will gain basic and, depending on their choice of specialty topic, deeper understanding of the application of dynamic systems to major fields in cognition.Third, students will appreciate the ubiquitous fractal structure of objects and processes in the real world as well as processes in cognition.",
    "Course Content": "Introduction to  various dynamical approaches to Cognitive Science (e.g., non-linear dynamical systems theory ,synergetics, chaos theory)-Basic mathematics of non-linear dynamical systems- Dynamical concepts (e.g., chaos, fractals, attractors, bifurcation, self-organization, symmetry-breaking)-Dynamical approaches in relation to computational and connectionist approaches to Cognitive Science-Theory, methodology and empirical applications of dynamical systems to major areas in Cognitive Science (neuronal self-organizations, visual perception, coordinated action, learning and memory, cognitive development, language/language acquisition, attention/consciousness, and social psychology)-The philosophy of emergence- Hands-on practical training with HTML-based educational material on the mathematics and science of fractals and chaos."
