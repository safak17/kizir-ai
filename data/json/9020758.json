    "Course Content": "This course is a survey of the properties of temporally controlled behavior in animals and humans, and the models that have been proposed to explain the neural mechanisms of timing and time perception. The course starts with readings the orderliness of behavior under experimental procedures where the duration of the signals controls behavior, with special emphasis on WeberÂ’s law in interval timing (aka the scalar property). Following a survey of the mathematical models that attempt to explain the scalar property, the course proceeds with readings on the neural mechanisms of timing and time perception. It is recommended to cognitive science, psychology, and biology students."
