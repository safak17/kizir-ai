Topics include nature of human concepts, inductive/deductive reasoning, creativity & insight in problem solving, decision making, probabilistic reasoning, visuospatial reasoning, development of thinking, scientific reasoning, practical/everyday reasoning, paradigms of cultural thought, mathematical cognition, collective reasoning and neural correlates of reasoning and decision making. Each topic will be discussed from several perspectives including psychology, cognitive neuroscience, cognitive modeling and cognitive anthropology.",
    "Course Learning Outcomes": "<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0; URL=noscript.html\">METU | Course SyllabusCourse Learning OutcomesBy the end of the course students will be expected to develop a thorough understanding of thinking, reasoning, problem solving and decision making concepts by reviewing both classical and contemporary accounts on the subject matter from multiple perspectives within Cognitive Science. Students are also expected to apply this theoretical knowledge to analysis of empirical data. The class will include an empirical data analysis component where students will be asked to design and analyze small scale experiments on related topics.",
