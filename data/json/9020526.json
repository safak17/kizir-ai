    "Course Content": "The course aims to introduce the students to the connections between philosophy and linguistics, with a focus on problems of meaning in both disciplines. After two introductory sessions on meaning in natural language and meaning in logic, the course proceeds with thematic units relevant to the interaction between natural language of logic: the language of logic, formal semantics, logical vs. pragmatic meaning, ordinary language philosophy, intentionality, and meaning in modern linguistics. The final portion of the course focuses on discussions on what different approaches to linguistic and logical meaning may imply in the study of cognitive phenomena."
