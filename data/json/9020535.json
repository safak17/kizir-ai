    "Course Objectives": "<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0; URL=noscript.html\">METU | Course SyllabusCourse ObjectivesThere are two major objectives of the course:First, in terms of theoretical knowledge, students will receive an overview over functional and neuroscientific theories of infant and child development as well as major topics in cognitive development. Topical areas comprise face perception; language development; emotional and affective development; understanding of human action; theory of mind; conceptual development; understanding the physical world; development of reasoning; understanding numerosity; development of attention, executive control and memory; time perception; understanding of normativity; development of tool use.Second, in terms of methodological skill, students will be guided to conduct an empirical research project with children, namely a hands-on small-scale study on any aspect related to cognitive development. This project work includes formulating a research question, operationalizing it, collecting and analyzing data (in the METU kindergarten (yuva ve anaokulu)), and writing it up as a project report.",
    "Course Learning Outcomes": "<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0; URL=noscript.html\">METU | Course SyllabusCourse Learning OutcomesAt the end of the course students will be(1) knowledgeable about various theoretical approaches to cognitive development (including neuroscience) and appreciate a developmental perspective on major topics in cognitive science, as detailed in the course objectives.(2) able to present and discuss these topic in a scientific manner, in a controversial and inter-disciplinary way.(3) conduct empirical research within the area of cognitive development independently or in a team and write their findings up in a scholarly project report.",
    "Course Content": "Development of infants (first 2 years of life) and pre-schoolers (2-6 years). Theories of development (nativist, empiricist, genetic epistemology, dynamic systems theory (DST)). Basic concepts of development: knowledge representation, learning, maturation, modularity, domain-general vs. domain-specific development, emergence. Research methodology and experimental paradigms. Basic milestones in the development of perception (language, face, objects, action) and production (language, imitation of othersÂ´ and planning of own actions), categorization, understanding the physical world, understanding human action, Theory of Mind (ToM), Reasoning/Logic, Causaliy, Number, Attention and Memory (WM and LTM). Developmental cognitive neuroscience, brain development."
