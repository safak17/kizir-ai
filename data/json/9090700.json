    "Course Content": "This course aims to develop an understanding of the history and principles of scientific method, as well as powers and limits of science. At a more practical level, the course is going to provide students with knowledge on deductive logic, probability, inductive logic and statistics, parsimony and efficiency and last but not least on ethics and responsibilities of science. More practical aspects of research such as communication of results will also be covered. The course will involve oral lectures as well as reading assignments and discussions in class. The assessment will be based on the reflection papers written by students as well as a larger critical reading assignment from a set of scientific monographys to be assigned at the beginning of semester. The students will, by the end of the semester, present a term report presenting a critical review of the reading assignment in light of the concepts presented throughout the semester."
