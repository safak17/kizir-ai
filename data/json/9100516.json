    "Course Content": "The concept of cybersecurity is critical in terms of national security, and as such has implications in both domestic and international law. Cybercrime poses a threat to cybersecurity, and has been made punishable by domestic and comparative law alike. Accordingly, the starting point of the course shall be to cover what constitutes cybercrime under the Turkish Criminal Code No. 5237. Secondly, we shall look at criminal activities defined under various laws, such as the Intellectual Property Act No.5846 and the Electronic Signature Act No. 5070. We shall elaborate on the legal aspect of cybercrime mitigation within the context of Turkish domestic law, and shall focus on the application process leading to legal internet access restriction. We shall go over the procedures of investigation and prosecution in light of related legislation. Finally, we will look at the legal process starting with the acquisition of digital evidence from the crime scene leading up to it being used to prove the existence of criminal elements at a court law, under the provisions of the Turkish Criminal Procedure Act No. 5271. The course aims to provide students who are expected to work in the field of cybersecurity with the necessary legal background by covering judicial decisions and various case studies."
