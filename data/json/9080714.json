    "Course Content": "Microarrays are now an established technology in molecular biology with increasing number of applications in genomics and proteomics research. The main objective of this course is to introduce the participants to advanced bioinformatics, statistical methodologies and software tools for analyzing managing various microarray data, such as transcriptomics, proteomics and genotyping. This course is aimed at advanced MS and PhD students and postdoctoral researchers who are applying or planning to apply microarray analysis and bioinformatics methods in their research. The course will be presented under three major topics. 1) Fundamentals of microarray technology 2) analytics of microarray process 3) microarray informatics while latest software packages is introduced within appropriate lectures."
