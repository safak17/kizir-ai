    "Course Content": "This course aims to explore the cognitive dimensions of collective intelligence in the context of human collaboration and cooperation. The research paradigms that study cognition beyond the actions and mental activities of an individual agent, such as distributed and extended cognition approaches, will be starting points for understanding human collaboration and cooperation in the forms of teamwork for small groups (that can afford direct, real-time, face-to-face, or online communication), and collective intelligence for organizations and societal structures. Starting from the relevant literature and research in cognitive science, contributions to the field from other research disciplines, including organizational behavior and theory, will be surveyed. A parallel literature of organizational behavioral sciences and industrial psychology has been studying collective cognition phenomena from perspectives of team collaboration, group dynamics and shared cognition. The main goal of this course is to examine and"
