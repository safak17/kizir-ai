    "Course Content": "Next Generation Sequence Analysis and Informatics course provides an introduction to methods for next-generation nucleic acid sequencing (NGS) data analysis. Students will learn most recent high-thoughput sequencing laboratory technologies and informatics tools for data analyses. Up to date best-practice methods and road maps will be discussed in detail. Data structures and algorithms for the NGS technologies and applications including variant detection, CHIP-seq, RNA-seq, de novo assembly, and targeted sequencing will be covered. Computational frameworks and toolkits such as SAMTools, BedTools, BWA, TopHat/Cufflinks, GATK, QIIME, R, and Galaxy will be exploited using sample data. The coursework involves case studies, one term project, homework assignments and exams."
