    "Course Content": "The course is designed for students to gain an understanding of issues of a real-world software project and enable them to apply their newly learned skills in a practical context. Students will be grouped into teams to undertake a software project with the tools, techniques and skills acquired during their previous course work. Each team will work as a software development group and assume the role of a quality assurance team for another group. The team will be assigned to a client and will interact with that client to engineer requirements, agree upon a design and achieve a successful acceptance test of a software system. Teams will meet on predetermined milestones with their faculty and quality assurance groups to discuss review results and progress."
