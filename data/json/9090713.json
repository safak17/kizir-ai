    "Course Content": "The course has been designed to give hands-on knowledge and development experience on general purpose GPU programming. The student will learn about the GPU as part of the PC architecture. Then they will learn about development of GPU software using CUDA C and OpenCL. Various optimization issues, particularly effective use of memory and floating point calculations will be discussed. The concepts and the effects of optimization will be demonstrated with case studies. Similarities and differences of CUDA and OpenCL will also be discussed around these case studies."
