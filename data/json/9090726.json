    "Course Content": "Seamless integration and interoperatibility of multimedia systems require standardization of the coding compression, storage and transmission of multimedia content. Several different international bodies such as ISO-MPEG, ITU, EBU,  developed standards for this purpose over the past decades and these developments allowed the proliferation of usage of digital multimedia content such as images, videos, audio and computer graphics. This course aims to teach audio, image, and graphics coding and equip the students with knowledge on the most important and common multimedia standards as well as future and emerging standards."
