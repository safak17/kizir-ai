    "Course Content": "This course introduces the building blocks of cognitive neuroscience both methodologically and conceptually. Basic methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, functional near infrared spectroscopy, eye tracking are explained and the underlying physiological foundations are discussed. Measurement of brain functions using these tools are illustrated through hands-on exercises. Foundations of the mind such as language, memory, attention, executive function and their anatomic correlates are studied."
