    "Course Content": "Software measurement is one of the essential components of good software management. In this course, the fundamentals of software measurement and estimation will be taught. The students will understand why we measure and how the measurement can be used to improve effectiveness of software engineering practices. The students will learn to specify the base and derived metrics in software projects. The specific metrics such as Lines of Code (LOC) and Functional Size will be elaborated in detail. The students will also learn how to initiate and maintain a measurement program in a software project."
