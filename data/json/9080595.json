    "Course Content": "Bioinformatics is an emerging scientific area. This interdisciplinary scientific domain is defined as the application of computer science and information technology to the field of molecular biology, bio-omics and biomedicine. Hence, the clear and concise understanding and analysis of the basic processes in living cells are fundamental to bioinformaticians. This course covers molecular and cellular biology topics which are designed especially for computer scientists and non-biology majors. The course provides information about biomolecules, cellular physiology, cell metabolism machinery, major signaling pathways, cell division, and pathological conditions such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders tailored for candidate bioinformaticians and computational biologists in a compact manner. Furthermore, experimental principles of recent high-throughput technologies and molecular biology and medicine, which requires computational data analysis, are also covered."
