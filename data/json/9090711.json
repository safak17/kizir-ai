    "Course Objectives": "<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0; URL=noscript.html\">METU | Course SyllabusCourse ObjectivesThe course will cover various concepts related to the understanding and processing of different types of multimedia sequence models. The course starts with an overview of sequence models, RNNs and continues with details on training RNNs. By introducing different sequence modelling problems, recurrent architectural models and variants of gated recurrent units, the course covers all fundamental concepts related to sequence learning in intelligent multimedia systems. In addition, the course covers the recurrent and nonrecurrent models of attention in various multimedia type signals such as vision and/or sound.",
