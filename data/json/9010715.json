    "Course Content": "The course introduces the students to the fundamental concepts of Game Theory and demonstrates the use of these concepts in data networking research. The focus is on covering the aspects of Non-cooperative Game Theory that would be instrumental in studying selfish behavior in data networks. The course structure is composed of formal lectures relating to Game Theory fundamentals followed by presentations/ discussions of recent research papers mainly in the field of information systems that exemplify the use of Game Theory in data networking research. Topics of interest include Network Formation, Internet Pricing, Flow Control, Routing, Medium Access Control, Network Security, Power Control (Wireless) and Spectrum Sharing (Wireless). Applications of Game Theory in various other fields, such as Economics, Business, Law and Political Science will also be illustrated in the final part of the course (specific choice of topics will be determined through student responses during the course)."
