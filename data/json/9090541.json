After a gentle introduction to game physics by presenting basic concepts, kinematics, force and kinetics, collision are given together with mathematical tools that are frequently used for physics based game programming.As computers are getting more powerful, game industry tends towards producing more “realistic” games. This course aims to build basic skills of implementing fundamental physics knowledge to produce more “realistic” games.",
