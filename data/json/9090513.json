    "Course Content": "A practical understanding of algorithms is necessary to develop interactive systems such as games, virtual/augmented/mixed reality and other interactive applications. This course aims to teach algorithms relevant in the context of designing interactive systems. The topics to be covered include random number generation, noise generation, procedural content generation, tournament modelling, game trees, path finding, group movement modelling, decision making and modelling uncertainty. Networking related topics will also be covered. The course is predominantly practical where the algorithms and their use will be described and implementation of major algorithms will be demonstrated with collaborative coding tools in class using Python. The assessment will be via programming assignments and a term project."
