    "Course Objectives": "<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0; URL=noscript.html\">METU | Course SyllabusCourse ObjectivesThere are two major objectives of the course:First, in terms of theoretical knowledge, students will receive a comprehensive overview over central areas and key aspects of human memory within the broader field of cognitive science. They will be exposed to memory systems, the various temporal scales of memory (Short-term memory, working memory, long-term memory), the neuro-cognitive bases of memory, amnesia, development of memory, implicit vs explicit memory, memory & language, memory & sleep, and memory augmentation.Second, in terms of methodological skill, students will be guided to conduct an empirical research project, namely a small-scale study on any aspect related to human memory. This project work includes formulating a research question, operationalizing it, collecting and analyzing data, and writing it up as a project report.",
    "Course Learning Outcomes": "<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0; URL=noscript.html\">METU | Course SyllabusCourse Learning OutcomesAt the end of the course students will(1) appreciate the role of memory within human cognition in a broad variety of aspects, as detailed in the course objectives as well as(2) conduct empirical research within the area of human memory independently and (possibly) contribute to the literature in the field.",
    "Course Content": "History of human memory research, memory taxonomies and memory systems, methods of memory research. The development and structure of Baddeley s Multiple Component Working Memory Model (phonological loop, visuo-spatial sketchpad, executive control, episodic buffer). The neurophysiology and neuroanatomy of memory, memory disorders. Dynamical memory. Episodic memory. Development of memory. Memory and language (processing and production). Implicit and explicit memory. False Memory. Memory and sleep."
