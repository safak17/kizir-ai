    "Course Content": "The course is an introduction to scientific computation and computer programming for graduate students with no prior programming background. Students will learn how to solve scientific problems with programming, how to write a complete program that gets inputs, perform computations and gives outputs by using loops, functions, and different data types. The course covers scientific problems from different areas to be solved with Python programs, which is a popular, general-purpose, open-source language and widely used in several areas of informatics in both industry and research fields."
