    "Course Content": "This course provides main tools to interpret the biomedical signals ranging from neural and cardiac rhythms to muscular activity.It takes a probabilistic signal processing approach and introduces traditional methods of time-frequency analysis as well as more recent issues of fractals,self-similarity,cross-frequency coupling and independent component analysis.Theory of methods shall be complemented with biomedical data applications emphasizing and motivating their use in practice."
