    "Course Content": "Translation of bioinformatics application into healthcare is leading the predictive medicine and allow personalized approaches in both diagnosis and treatment. Thus there is an emerging need for bioinformatics who can analyze and interpret results of large genomics data sets and manage investigation of disease related variations and genes. Through formal lectures, students will learn the fundamentals of clinical bioinformatics, review the current software/tools/platforms, and relevant genomic/bioinformatics resources for the analysis of the genomics data. Critical reading assignments and discussion of case studies will allow students to understand current strategies, bioinformatics pipelines, and standard procedures. The program students who have completed the course will be informed about the current applications of bioinformatics in medical genetics and trained in clinical uses of bioinformatics."
