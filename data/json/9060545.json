    "Course Learning Outcomes": "<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0; URL=noscript.html\">METU | Course SyllabusCourse Learning OutcomesStudents, who are successful in the course will be able to:use both object oriented and functional programming constructs to design maintainable, and resilient software composed of clearly encapsulated, and loosely coupled objects.analyze the runtime performance (in terms of time, memory and I/O) of their software solutions and alternatives.Be able to design performant algorithms for common information processing tasks, recursive or otherwisechoose, based on the problem, or implement the most suitable data structures, or combinations thereof",
    "Course Content": "Basic Object Oriented Principles will be discussed using a modern programming language i.e. Java. Theoretical approaches will be developed to implement Data Structures which is very important in algorithm development. The core of the class will be depend on using object oriented principles to implement algorithms in Data Structures using Java. Although some reading is required, practice is more important in learning any programming language."
