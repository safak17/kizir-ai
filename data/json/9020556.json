    "Course Learning Outcomes": "<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0; URL=noscript.html\">METU | Course SyllabusCourse Learning OutcomesThe students will learn the scientific concept of vision as a perceptual and cognitive phenomenon. The learning outcomes will include knowledge about the visual system (the eye-brain) system in humans and animals, from the perspective of anatomy, as well as physiology. From the perspective of theoretical framework, both classical and information processing theories of vision will be covered in learning outcomes. Practical skills will be transferred through laboratory experiments on eye tracking, as well as eye tracking theory, and measures.",
    "Course Content": "The course covers sensory, perceptual, and cognitive processes related to vision from a mainly psychological viewpoint supported by neuroscientific and computational information where appropriate.  Content includes  discussion  of theoretical approaches to vision and a survey of empirical research on main problems related to vision. Information on classic research will be supplemented by examination of contemporary research on central issues."
