    "Course Content": "This course introduces the tools of Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data analysis to capture brain dynamics with fast temporal sampling. It will provide the relation between neuronal activity and electro-magnetic mapping, necessary physics of measured sensor data, brain source localization and identification. Various preprocessing tools, time-frequency analysis, brain source reconstruction methods will also be covered. Theory will be complemented by hands-on sessions in which students will be tutored through the complete analysis of EEG and MEG dataset with popular free online data analysis packages. The functional image of the brain will be studied with simulated and real EEg and MEG data projected on MR images."
