    "Course Content": "This course aims to give students professional experience in information systems development. Student teams work on the specification, design, implementation and acceptance testing phases of different information systems projects. Each team works on a different phase of a different project and produces professional quality documentation. The documentation is distributed among all teams, who then collectively participate in formal review sessions held in class for each phase of each project. Project topics may be selected from diverse areas such as engineering, business management, provided that the project plan is realistic and the estimated duration fits a semester."
