    "Course Content": "This is an introduction to descriptive linguistics from a cognitive science perspective. No prior knowledge of linguistics is required. Main empirical domains to be covered are phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics and psycholinguistics. The course focuses on cognitive underpinnings, i.e., symbolic, structural and compositional aspects of language. It is intended to help students (i) approach language in an analytical manner, (ii) explore linguistic puzzles that need theoretical explanation, and (iii) find their topics of interest for further studies and research."
