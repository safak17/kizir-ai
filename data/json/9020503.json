    "Course Content": "This course introduces the various empirical domains and research methodologies of Cognitive Science to new-coming students. Students will first be introduced to the history of Cognitive Science and to major debates in the field (rationalism vs. empiricism, modularity, meaning of data). Subsequently the major empirical research domains of Cognitive Science will be covered on a weekly basis (language, vision, attention, learning and memory, theory of mind, action, evolution, brain, emotional and social aspects of cognition.) General academic skills such as academic reading, writing and discussion will be fostered through homework assignments and active in-class participation of students. Specific academic skills will be conveyed through three alternating blocks of teaching and practical hands-on training (conducting and analyzing experiments, collecting and presenting own data). The course aims at providing an overview over the inter-disciplinary field of Cognitive Science and to motivating students to further explore the various tracks offered by the program in their subsequent studies (computation, linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, and psychology.)"
