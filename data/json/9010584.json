    "Course Content": "This course aims to give background knowledge on several related to text analytics using deep learning. Natural language processing (NLP) concepts and NLP applications, deep learning methods for NLP, evaluation techniques, word embedding, Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, transformer models are some of the core concepts that will be covered through the lectures. The course will introduce both theoretical and practical skills in the domain. In addition, other application areas using the models initially proposed for NLP tasks will also be taught. At the end of the course, students will be familiar with cutting-edge deep networks for NLP."
