    "Course Content": "History and development of connectionism. The dispute between nativism and empiricism; symbols and rules vs. patterns and associations; connectionism and the cognitive sciences; connectionism and dynamical systems; perspectives and limitations of connectionism. Basic concepts of connectionist networks. Learning to work and doing exercises with a simple connectionist network (T-learn). Applications of connectionist modelling: human cognitive development, language acquisition (the English past tense debate), language production and processing, person perception, human consciousness, music."
