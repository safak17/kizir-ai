    "Course Content": "This course covers main issues in semantic analysis and model building in the cognitive linguistics tradition. It focuses on tropics which are in close relation to cognitive science: prototype theory of categorization, cross-domain mappings (metaphor, metonymy, analogy), embodied cognition, conceptualization and construal, perception-based focal adjustments, frames,image schemas, force dynamics, mental spaces, and conceptual integration."
